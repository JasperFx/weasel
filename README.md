Weasel is a library for low level database development with Postgresql and Sql Server. Weasel is in the process of being extracted from [Marten](https://martendb.io) with the goal of making this code reusable in other projects.

While Weasel is open source, [JasperFx Software offers paid support and consulting contracts](https://bit.ly/3szhwT2) for Weasel. 


## Running tests locally

To run tests, you need to set up databases locally. The easiest option is to do it by running Docker images. You can use [predefined Docker Compose setup](./docker-compose.yml) by calling in your terminal:

```bash
docker compose up
```

It'll spin up PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases.

Then, you can run tests from the terminal:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Or your favourite IDE.

### Test Config Customization

Some of our tests are run against a particular PostgreSQL version. If you'd like to run different database versions, you can do it by setting `POSTGRES_IMAGE` or `MSSQL_IMAGE` env variables, for instance:

```bash
POSTGRES_IMAGE=postgres:15.3-alpine MSSQL_IMAGE=mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest docker compose up
```

Tests explorer should be able to detect database version automatically, but if it's not able to do it, you can enforce it by setting `postgresql_version` to a specific one (e.g.)

```shell
postgresql_version=15.3
```

By default Postgres tests are run with case insensitive names. To run tests against case sensitive, set environment variable:

```
USE_CASE_SENSITIVE_QUALIFIED_NAMES=true
```

### Nuke

There's now a very rudimentary Nuke build, but it just compiles the solution. What it **does** do is provide two tasks for development:

```shell
nuke attach
```

and 

```shell
nuke detach
```

To switch back and forth between using JasperFx as a project reference (Attach) or Nuget reference (Detach).
